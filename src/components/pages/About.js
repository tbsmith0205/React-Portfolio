          My name is Taylor Smith, and I am currently in the Full Stack Web
          Development course at the University of Denver. I am originally from
          North Carolina where I attended North Carolina State University for
          Business IT and obtained a minor in Spanish. I love sports, especially
          the NC State Wolfpack, Carolina Panthers, Charlotte Hornets, and West
          Ham United. I am excited to begin a new career change and cannot wait
          to become a web developer.
